;    Takes as input an integer N. It then builds and returns a "select" function based on N.

(define singleSelect          ; return a funtion which remove the first element of a list
  (lambda (L) (cdr L)))

(define (multiCompose n F)    ; return the power n of a function
  (if (= n 1) F
      (compose (multiCompose (- n 1) F) F)))

(define (selectN n)           ; return a function with power n of the singleSelect function.  
  (lambda (L) ((multiCompose n singleSelect)L)))
