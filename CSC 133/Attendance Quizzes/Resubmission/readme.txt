Hello Professor,

I'm resubmitting my A3, Attendance Quiz 5, and Attendance Quiz 10. 

I have resubmitted A3 on Canvas already. Implemented the sound mute option and missile launcher rotation option. I also spent all of yesterday helping Amrit Singh with his A3 issues and getting it to a working state. I believe I have so far demonstrated a solid understanding of A3.

I chose not to redo my midterm since I got a 10/15 on the redo already. The only thing I lost points on was the source code was missing for the problems I redid. 

Also, I believe I was marked absent mistakenly on 4/18 or 4/23. I showed up to the afternoon session on both dates. I left early on 4/18 for my interview and I'm sure I came on 4/23 because I submitted the attendance quiz 9 on that date. 

I hope I can pass your class because I have demonstrated very good understanding of course material and have put in a lot of effort into the assignments. Most of the points I lost on the assignments were due to late submission and .jar file issues. For example, on A2, I lost over 30 points due to .jar issue alone. I have been able to implement nearly all features, tools, design patterns that have been taught this semester and for this reason I believe I have earned a passing grade. Of course, it is at your discretion. 

Regardless, you have taught us very well. I appreciate it very much. 

Thank you very much for a very enjoyable semester!
Best wishes to you and your family, and hope you have a safe journey back home!
